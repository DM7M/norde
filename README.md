#### Note: This is the Aliucord version of this theme. <!-- Norde for Vendetta coming soon! -->

## Requirements
- [Themer](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/tree/main/Themer) module installed
  - Transparency mode set to Chat
  - Custom font enabled

## What's new?

### Removal of Norde-Asterisk
- Despite my attempts to make Asterisk stand out, it still somehow ended up looking like a clone of Norde, so I decided to just get rid of it.

### Nord
- Formerly Nord-Schwa, now modified to use the Nord palette (with minor exceptions in order to make the theme look nicer).
##### You can check the full changelog [here](https://github.com/kartoflu/norde/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

If you encounter any issue (ex. theme not loading properly), please see the #theme-support section in the official [Aliucord Support Server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) (check the pinned messages first, thank you) to troubleshoot your problem.

### Alternative Installation Method
In case my links in theme distribution channel are broken, you can manually install them by following these steps:
1. From this page, scroll up, click the blue "View code" line and select the *themes* folder
2. In *themes*, choose the one you want to be installed
3. When the page is loaded, click the 3 dots button on the right side of the codeblock header (the box with colorful codes), then hit Download
4. Using a file manager (ex. ZArchiver), move the downloaded theme to Aliucord > Themes

Now just restart Aliucord and enable the newly installed theme like normal.
